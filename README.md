The goal of this project was educational: to understand CosmWasm contract structure and logic fundamentals.

# My Custom Boilerplate for Smart Contracts

This project is a customized CosmWasm smart contract boilerplate developed during a technical Web3 course.

## 🧱 What's Included

- Rust contract with modular folder structure
- Pre-configured Cargo and schema files
- Ready-to-deploy smart contract logic
- CircleCI config for continuous integration

## 🎯 Objective

To build reusable starting points for CosmWasm development — accelerating new contract creation and prototyping.

## 🧠 Status

Template-based, used as a starting point for future real-world projects.
